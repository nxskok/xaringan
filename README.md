## My first go at using Xaringan.

[The R markdown
code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/xaringan/master/my_test.Rmd)
that produced my presentation. Download it and run it yourself in R
Studio. (The whole repo is an R Studio project.)

I tried uploading my HTML presentation, but it doesnâ€™t display right.
There need to be some other things with it.
